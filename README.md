# Kaggle Tabular Playground Series

The **Tabular Playground Series** is designed to provide the Kaggle community with light-weight, accessible challenges to learn and enhance skills in machine learning and data science. Each competition offers an opportunity to:

- Experiment with various models and feature engineering techniques.
- Create visualizations and analyze results.
- Iterate quickly using manageable datasets.

## Key Features
- **Duration:** Competitions typically last a few weeks, though this may vary based on the challenge.
- **Datasets:** Challenges use synthetically-generated datasets inspired by real-world data, ensuring:
  - Named features for a realistic feel.
  - Test labels remain private to maintain competition integrity.

## Why Synthetic Data?
Synthetic data allows to balance realism with competition fairness. Over the two years since the Tabular Playground Series began, significant improvements have been made in dataset generation, resulting in fewer artifacts and more interesting datasets.
